## Problem 1

First we need to read in the data.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Next we will create a `city_state` variable and a binary variable
indicating whether the homicide is solved. We will also omit the cities
Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City, MO; and Tulsa, AL. Lastly, we will
modify `victim_race` to have categories white and non-white, with white
as the reference category, and change victim\_age to a numeric variable.

``` r
US_hom_data = homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(state = toupper(state), city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
        solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest", FALSE, TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX", city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", city_state != "Kansas City, MO", city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "White", "Non-White"),
         victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("White", "Non-White")),
         victim_age  = as.numeric(victim_age))
```
